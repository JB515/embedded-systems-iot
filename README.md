# Product Ideas

## Automated wind break

Borrowing a lot from the FlipFlic this could take, as input, the windspeed on a beach and adjust a flap-based windbreak. For the physical form, think along the lines of a Venetian blind laid out on its side, probably with larger flaps.


## Emergency tent anchor

Put the airflow sensor on top of a tent and a hosepipe into a nearby stream. If the wind becomes strong enough that there could be a risk of the tent blowing away, water could be pumped into a bag fixed to the base of the tent, adding weight and anchoring it to the ground. We could add some sort of warning system (via an app or siren) to alert the owner to the impending loss of their shelter.


## Fire extinguisher

Similar setup to the above, except with the hose feeding the base of a fire. If there is a risk of air blowing the fire into a tent or another flammable object, water would be pumped into the fire, putting it out.


## Drone pitot

A pitot is the small tube visible on aircraft wings and noses that uses air pressure to determine accurate speed. Our sensor could offer a low cost alternative for a drone. Implementation should be self-explanatory. Could also apply to a bike (at low speed).


## Automatic door/window closer

If the sensor detects a draft coming from an open door or window, close it automatically. Simples!
